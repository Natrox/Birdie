Birdie is a concept for a real-time debugger. It hooks into memory and displays variables added from the application's side through a C-API.
It's a very early work-in-progress project. It is intended to offer an alternative to in-game debug text.
Birdie also allows developers to create small variable-parsing functions, to show variables in a customized way in Birdie. For example:
* If you keep track of different colors of light, you can render a colored circle or icon.
* If your enemies have a health bars, you can render them within Birdie.
* If you have a wireframe view, you can forward a framebuffer to Birdie.

These things are already functional, and you can use them right now. However, I still need to document it here.

Additionally, for the future I want to add a persistent logging feature similar to Android's LogCat. This will collate warnings and errors generated by a program - and store them on disk.
